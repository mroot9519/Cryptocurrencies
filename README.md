# Cryptocurrencies
Used unsupervised machine learned to uncover trends within a cryptocurrency dataset. Particularly, the model highlights the summary effects Total Coin Supply, Algorithm Type, Total Coins Mined, and Prooftype have on the overall behavior of the cryptocurrency. 

Pandas was used to clean the dataset before input into the model. For instance, nulls were droped, unncessary columns dropped, and named vectors encoded using sklearn Label Encoder program.

An elbow curve was generated to determine the appropriate number of clusters for the algorithm. Because of the number of features, Principal Component Analysis was completed to speed up the process.
